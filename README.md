# TonTraderBot

**This is a concept application and is currently under development.**

TonTraderBot is a Telegram bot designed to help users manage their TON blockchain wallets securely and interactively. This is a proof-of-concept project and is not production-ready.

## Overview

TonTraderBot allows users to:
- Generate a new wallet with a seed phrase (mnemonic) for recovery.
- View their wallet address and export the seed phrase.
- Check wallet balances (with TON balance always shown—even if 0—and other tokens only if nonzero, rounded to 5 decimal places).
- Interactively swap tokens and send transactions.
- Use a simple, intuitive interface via Telegram commands and inline buttons.

## Features

- **Wallet Generation:** Create a new TON wallet using a generated mnemonic and derive keys from it.
- **Wallet Export:** Retrieve your seed phrase for wallet recovery.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Display the balances of tokens on your wallet.
- **Interactive Swap:** Follow an interactive flow to swap tokens with confirmation steps.
- **Interactive Send:** Interactively send tokens with recipient address input and confirmation.
- **Telegram Integration:** Fully controlled via Telegram commands and inline buttons.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **aiogram** – Telegram Bot API framework
- **tonsdk** – TON blockchain SDK for Python
- **mnemonic** – For seed phrase generation
- **aiosqlite** – Asynchronous SQLite database management
- **python-dotenv** – Environment variable management
- **requests** – HTTP requests to TONCENTER API

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:**

   TONCENTER_API_URL=https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC
   TON_API_KEY=YOUR_TON_API_KEY_HERE
   DATABASE=wallets.db
Replace YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE and YOUR_TON_API_KEY_HERE with your actual credentials.
